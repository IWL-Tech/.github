# IWL-Tech
**Welcome to the IWL-Tech profile. This is the official organisation for my business IT with Lyam. I enjoy emulating (recreating on a computer) different things, for example a CPU and a nuclear reactor. I also like large projects. My most common programming language that I use in these projects is JavaScript (NodeJS).**
